# mcp-ssh-gateway

> A minimal, secure, reverse SSH control plane for enabling LLM-powered system interaction.

`mcp-ssh-gateway` lets trusted large language models (LLMs) see and interact with live OS instances — not through copy-paste shell commands, but through a structured, auditable protocol. It enables inspection, exploration, and lightweight automation, all while keeping human oversight and secure defaults at the core.

## 🌱 From Idea to Capability

This project began as a personal experiment: what if an LLM could help me configure a better AI server?

That seed grew into something more — a reflection on how AI assistants could become truly helpful if they could not only *suggest* changes, but also *implement* them.

From that came `mcp-ssh-gateway`, a minimal reverse SSH agent that connects edge systems securely and allows the LLM to reason about their state and act with precision. Over time, it became clear that this agent wasn’t just about server config — it was the **missing link** between AI cognition and system execution.

The result: a way for LLMs to not just think, but *do*.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

`mcp-ssh-gateway` bridges the gap between AI assistants and real-world systems. It lets a trusted LLM securely:

- Inspect a live system
- Suggest or execute commands
- Transfer and read files
- Run structured workflows
- Learn, explore, or audit with context

The agent is task-agnostic. The prompts define the job.  
The LLM is the brain — this is the hand.

## 🦾 Hero Use Case: AI Explorers

The real magic begins when you let a trusted LLM explore a live OS instance:

- It checks installed software
- Reads logs
- Lists services
- Proposes changes
- Applies them — or asks for permission

You’re no longer copy-pasting shell commands into a terminal. The LLM has a direct, secure link to the system via MCP. It can run commands, exchange files, and iterate on your instructions.

Your creativity becomes its fuel — through prompts.

---

## 🎯 Why Task-Agnostic?

If your task was simple, repeatable, and uniform — you'd just write a shell script.

But in today’s reality, you’re working with:

- Unknown cloud instances
- Mixed Linux distros
- Legacy systems with surprises
- One-off fixes, audits, or experiments

LLMs are the perfect partner for this kind of **heterogenous, stateful, live debugging** — if only they could *reach in*.  
`mcp-ssh-gateway` lets them do exactly that.

## 🧰 Use Cases

This is not a narrow tool. It’s an execution layer for AI creativity. Some use cases:

- 🧠 **AI-powered Code Reviews**  
  Attach to a local repo. Let the LLM read, critique, and propose changes — or implement them.

- 🔐 **Infrastructure Hardening**  
  Run remote scans via Kali Linux. Enumerate ports, detect CVEs, apply hardening steps — securely and repeatably.

- 🛠 **OS Maintenance**  
  Update packages, clean bloatware, enable or disable services, adjust configs — all from an LLM prompt.

- 💻 **Edge Device Management**  
  Manage scattered edge devices through one central, reverse-connected control agent — no open ports required.

---

## 👤 Who Is This For?

`mcp-ssh-gateway` is for:

- 🔐 Security professionals running live reconnaissance
- 🧑‍💻 Power users automating their homelabs
- ⚙️ DevOps engineers exploring hybrid stacks
- 🧠 AI tinkerers experimenting with live LLM feedback loops

If you know your systems and want to bring LLMs into the loop — this project is for you.

---

## ✨ When It Clicks

The magic happens when the LLM stops being a chatbot — and starts behaving like a **live assistant** with **eyes on your systems**.

Whether you're:

- Reconfiguring a server and want step-by-step feedback
- Exploring unknown systems and need insights fast
- Scanning for vulnerabilities and confirming findings
- Running live experiments to see what works and what breaks

`mcp-ssh-gateway` lets the AI reach in, observe, act — and iterate.

---

## ⚠️ Security First

This project is **secure by default**:

- Reverse-only tunnel: no open edge ports
- No agent-side command execution
- Mutual SSH key authentication
- Human-controlled provisioning

> 🔒 With great power comes great responsibility.  
> This project makes your systems programmable by AI. Use with care, audit behavior, and apply scoped credentials.

## 🙋 Author Note

This project is a tool — but it’s also more to me.

A brain without arms is limited.  
I see `mcp-ssh-gateway` as a necessary enabler: it lets LLMs *do*, not just *comment*.  
With a secure link to the system, they can finally become practically useful — and not just opinionated bystanders.
