## âœ… Security by Design

`mcp-ssh-gateway` is designed with the following principles:

- Reverse SSH only: edge devices initiate connections
- No command execution allowed on the agent
- Strict key-based authentication
- Audit-friendly: deterministic, observable behavior
- Secure by default: no open ports on edge systems

---

## ðŸ›¡ Security Best Practices

To further protect your deployment:

- Run in isolated Docker containers or sandboxed environments
- Rotate SSH keys periodically
- Monitor outbound connections from edge devices
- Limit LLM instructions to audited prompts
